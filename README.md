# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

For each plot

Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

Name each of the plot files as \color{red}{\verb|plot1.png|}plot1.png, \color{red}{\verb|plot2.png|}plot2.png, etc.

Create a separate R code file (\color{red}{\verb|plot1.R|}plot1.R, \color{red}{\verb|plot2.R|}plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in \color{red}{\verb|plot1.R|}plot1.R constructs the \color{red}{\verb|plot1.png|}plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.

Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. 

There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.
